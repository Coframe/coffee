The following prompt is a composition of prompt sections, each with different preference levels. Higher preference levels override lower preference levels. The lowest preference level, PREFERENCE LEVEL 1, will likely be a broad guideline of some sort. Prompt sections with higher preference levels are likely to be more specific instructions that would override sections with lower preference levels. Each prompt section will start with "PREFERENCE LEVEL (level)".
