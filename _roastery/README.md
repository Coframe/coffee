# ðŸ«˜ Roastery
Folder for experimental flavors and test environments.
If it's ready, serve by moving to the root folder.

## Why?
It's important try new DX ideas and learn what's good and what's not.
Having these experiments in a separate folder allows us to avoid secondary repos and branches and keeps everything up to date.
