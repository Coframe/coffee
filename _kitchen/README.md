# 🧑‍🍳 Kitchen
Folder for experimental flavors and test environments.
If it's ready, serve by moving to the root folder.

## Why?
It's important try new dev x ideas and learn what is good and what is not.
Having those expriments in separate folder, allows to avoid secondary repos and branches and keep everythin up to date.
